# Chapter 8 The IO Library and 280 main()

This markdown includes chapter 8 from C++ Primer as well as some supplementary materials from 280 lectures. 

## 8.1 The IO Classes

 - iostream : defines the basic types used to read from and write to a stream
   - istream - read from a stream
   - ostream - writes to a stream
   - iostream - read and  write a stream
  - fstream : defines the types used to read and write named files
    - ifstream - read from a files
    - ofstream - write to a file
    - fstream - read and write a file
   - sstream: defines the types used to read and write in-memory strings
     - istringstream - read from a string
     - ostringstream - writes to a string  
     - iostringstream - read and writes a string

Note: ifstream and istringstream inherit from istream; same for others

### No Copy or Assignment for IO Objects

    ofstream out1, out2;
    out1 = out2; //ERROR
    out2 = print(out1); //ERROR

### Condition State

   
|strm::iostate| strm is one of IO types, while iostate is a machine-dependent integral type that represents the condition state of a stream |
|--|--|
| strm::badbit | iostate indicates that a stream is corrupted |
| strm::failbit | iostate indicates that an IO operation failed |
| strm::eofbit | iostate indicates that a stream hits end-of-file |
| strm::goodbit | iostate indicates that a stream not in an errror state. This value guranteed to be zero |
| s.eof() | true if *eofbit* in the stream *s* is set |
| s.bad() | true if *failbit* or *badbit* in the stream *s* is set |
| s.good() | true if the stream in a valid state|
| s.clear() | reset all conditions values in *s* to valid state, return void |
| s.rdstate() | return the current state of the stream s |


Example:

    int c;
    cin >> c;
There will be errors if we input a *bool* instead of *int*.


### Managing the output buffer

each output stream manages a buffer, which it uses to hold the data that the program reads and writes. 

Because writing to a device can be time-consuming, letting the operating system combine several output operations into a single write can provide an important performance boost.

Buffer is **flushed** when 

 - The program completes normally. All output buffers are flushed as part of the return from main.
 - At some indeterminate time, the buffer can become full, in which case it will be flushed before writing the next value.
 - We can use the unitbuf manipulator to set the stream’s internal state to empty the buffer after each operation.
 - An output stream might be tied to another stream. In this case, the buffer of the tied stream is flushed whenever the tied stream is read or written. By default, cin and cerr are both tied to cout. Hence, reading cin or writing to cerr flushes the buffer in cout.

Example:

    cout << "hi!" << endl; // writes hi and a newline, then flushes the buffer
    cout << "hi!" << flush; // writes hi, then flushes the buffer; adds no data
    cout << "hi!" << ends; // writes hi and a null, then flushes the buffer

> Caution: Buffers are not flushed if the program crashes
> The output could be pending while the program already crashes

## 8.2 files

    ifstream in(ifiles);
    ofstream out; // output file stream that is not associated with any file
    out.open(ifile + ".copy"); // open the specified file

Verify the files is open:

    if (out) // check that the open succeeded

close a files and open another:

    in.close(); // close the file
    in.open(ifile + "2"); // open another file

## Additional - argument parsing

Our main would look like

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    //or
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])

Command-line arugments example

    $ ./redact bee in.txt out.txt 10
usually, argv[0] would point to either the name of the program or to the empty string

 - argc - number of arguments
 - argv - an array of C-string arguments

above is

 1. argv[0] = ./redact\0
 2. argv[1] = bee\0
 3. argv[2] = in.txt\0
 4. argv[3] = out.txt\0
 5. argv[4] = 10\0

 Note: `atoi` and `stoi`parses an integer value encoded in a C-style string
 
Note that the atoi() function will silently fail if the string is not convertible to an int, while by default stoi() will throw an exception.
