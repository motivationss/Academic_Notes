\chapter{Game Theory}\label{ch:game-theory}
\lecture{18}{8 Nov. 12:30}{Game Theory}
We now turn to a new topic, game theory. The goal is to analyze situations with \hyperref[rationality]{rational} \hyperref[def:player]{agents}
who want to maximize their won \hyperref[def:reward]{rewards} under a particular structured \hyperref[def:game]{game}.

\section{Game}
We restrict a \hyperref[def:game]{game} with the following structure.
\begin{definition}[Game]\label{def:game}
	A \emph{game} has \hyperref[def:player]{players}, and each \hyperref[def:player]{player} has a set of \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies} and
	a \hyperref[def:reward]{reward} function.

	\begin{definition}[Player]\label{def:player}
		\emph{Players}, also called \emph{agents}, are the participants of the \hyperref[def:game]{game}.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Strategy]\label{def:strategy}
		\emph{Strategies}, also called \emph{actions}, are a set of choices a \hyperref[def:player]{player} can perform in a \hyperref[def:game]{game}.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Reward]\label{def:reward}
		\emph{Rewards}, also called \emph{utilities} or \emph{payoffs}, is the return for each \hyperref[def:player]{player} based on the played
		\hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies} of all \hyperref[def:player]{players} (including self).
	\end{definition}
\end{definition}
\begin{note}[Assumptions of a game]
	We make some assumptions of a \hyperref[def:game]{game}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There are (\textbf{finite}, infinite) number of \hyperref[def:player]{players}.
		\item Each player has a (\textbf{finite}, infinite) set of \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies} to choose from, homogeneous or inhomogeneous
	\end{itemize}
\end{note}

Besides the assumptions of \hyperref[def:game]{game} structure, we also have some assumptions for the \hyperref[def:player]{player}.
\begin{note}[Assumptions of players]
	We make some assumptions of \hyperref[def:player]{players}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item\label{common-knowledge} Common knowledge: All \hyperref[def:player]{agents} know all other players' \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy}
		set and \hyperref[def:reward]{payoffs}. Basically means each \hyperref[def:player]{player} knows everything about the structure of the \hyperref[def:game]{game}.
		\item\label{rationality} Rationality: All \hyperref[def:player]{agents} are fully \emph{rational} and self utility maximizer.
	\end{itemize}
\end{note}
\begin{remark}
	As a result of \hyperref[common-knowledge]{common knowledge}, everyone knows that all \hyperref[def:player]{agents} are \hyperref[rationality]{rational}.
\end{remark}

By above two assumptions, \hyperref[def:player]{players} succeed in selecting optimal \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies}, and our goal is to understand
these optimal \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies}.

\section{Normal Form}
For simplicity, we also assume the \hyperref[def:reward]{payoffs} are finite, but this is nearly all the case, so we just assumed it.

\begin{definition}[One-shot game]\label{def:one-shot-game}
	A \hyperref[def:game]{game} is a \emph{one-shot Game} if \hyperref[def:player]{players} will simultaneously and \hyperref[def:independent]{independently}
	choose their \hyperref[def:strategy]{actions}, and they do so only once in this game.
\end{definition}

We note that contrarily, there are games called \hyperref[def:dynamic-game]{dynamic game}.
\begin{definition}[Dynamic game]\label{def:dynamic-game}
	A \hyperref[def:game]{game} is a \emph{dynamic game} if \hyperref[def:strategy]{actions} can be played sequentially over time for \hyperref[def:player]{players}
	in the \hyperref[def:game]{game}.
\end{definition}

Now, we see some examples which are all \hyperref[def:one-shot-game]{one-shot game} and is in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-form_game}{normal form}, i.e.,
can be described in a matrix.

\begin{definition}[Payoff matrix]\label{def:payoff-matrix}
	If we tabulate all combinations of \hyperref[def:player]{players}' \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies} and the corresponding \hyperref[def:reward]{payoffs} in a
	form of matrix, then we call the matrix the \emph{payoff matrix}. We'll soon see lots of examples.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	A \hyperref[def:game]{game} is in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-form_game}{normal form} simply means if we can write out its corresponding
	\hyperref[def:payoff-matrix]{payoff matrix}. But we'll see that describing a \hyperref[def:game]{game} in such a way will lose some information.
\end{remark}

Before we see the examples, we make the following notions about characterizing \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy}.
\begin{definition}[Dominant strategy]\label{def:dominant-strategy}
	The \emph{(strictly) dominant strategy} is the optimal response to every others' \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} of the other \hyperref[def:player]{players}
	in the sense that the \hyperref[def:reward]{payoffs} of this \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} is strictly better in any cases.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Weakly dominant strategy]\label{def:weakly-dominant-strategy}
	The \emph{weakly dominant strategy} is the optimal response to every others' \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} of the other \hyperref[def:player]{players}
	in the sense that the \hyperref[def:reward]{payoffs} of this \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} is better in any cases.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	Comparison between \hyperref[def:dominant-strategy]{strictly} and \hyperref[def:weakly-dominant-strategy]{weakly dominant strategy}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \hyperref[def:dominant-strategy]{Strictly dominant strategy}: The \hyperref[def:reward]{payoff} is strictly higher in all cases.
		\item \hyperref[def:weakly-dominant-strategy]{Weakly dominant strategy}: This \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} is always in the best \hyperref[def:strategy]{action} set.
		      But in some cases, some other \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies} will give you the same \hyperref[def:reward]{payoff}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{eg}[Prisoner's dilemma]\label{eg:prisoner-dilemma}
	Assume that two people are taken for investigation of a crime. They're interrogated simultaneously and in different rooms, so
	they can't communicate. Each of them is offered the choice to confess or not.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two \hyperref[def:player]{players}.
		\item \hyperref[def:strategy]{Actions} set: \(\left\{\text{confess} (\mathrm{C}), \text{not confess} (\mathrm{NC})\right\}\).
		\item \hyperref[def:reward]{Payoffs}: There are four possibilities:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item If you confess and partner doesn't, then you are released and partner gets \(10\) years in jail.
			      \item If you don't confess and partner confess, then you'll get \(10\) years and partner released.
			      \item If both confess, both get \(4\) years.
			      \item If both do not confess, both get charges on minor crime, which will let them get \(1\) year.
		      \end{itemize}
		      We can then define so-called \hyperref[def:payoff-matrix]{payoff matrix},
		      \begin{table}[H]
			      \centering
			      \setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}
			      \begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|}
				                                                     & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\hyperref[def:player]{Player} 2}                                    \\
				                                                     & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\mathrm{NC}$}                   & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\mathrm{C}$} \\\cline{3-4}
				      \multirow{2}*{\hyperref[def:player]{Player} 1} & $\mathrm{NC}$        & $(-1, -1)$                                          & $(-10, 0)$                       \\\cline{3-4}
				                                                     & $\mathrm{C}$         & $(0, -10)$                                          & $(-4, -4)$                       \\\cline{3-4}
			      \end{tabular}
		      \end{table}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{problem}
	How will you react?
	\end{problem}
	\begin{answer}
		We first see what \hyperref[def:strategy]{action} should suspect 1 plays based on \hyperref[rationality]{rational} analysis. Suspect 1's reasoning
		should be as follows:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If suspect 2 confess \(\to \) since \(-4> -10 \implies\) the best \hyperref[def:strategy]{action} is to confess.
			\item If suspect 2 don't confess \(\to \) since \(0>-1 \implies\) the best \hyperref[def:strategy]{action} is to confess.
		\end{itemize}
		Since this problem is symmetric, namely the \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} for both suspects are the same, so both of them will confess, leading to an equilibrium.
	\end{answer}
	\begin{remark}
		We see that
		\begin{itemize}
			\item No hidden \hyperref[def:reward]{payoffs} other than what we have in \hyperref[def:payoff-matrix]{payoff matrix}.
			\item Both not confessing is better as a pair (in the sense that if we sum the \hyperref[def:reward]{payoffs}). We see that utilize sum is not
			      maximized, which means this action is not \emph{efficient}.
			\item Confessing is the best option of the other suspect's choice. In this case, confessing is a \hyperref[def:dominant-strategy]{dominant strategy}.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{remark}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}[Golden ball]\label{eg:golden-ball}
	Two \hyperref[def:player]{players} have two options, one is split, and another is steal. And there are \(x\) amounts of money in total. If both \hyperref[def:player]{players}
	choose split, then they can both get half of the money; if one chooses split and another chooses steal, the \hyperref[def:player]{player} chooses steal can get all the money
	while another \hyperref[def:player]{player} get nothing. If both choose steal, then they both get nothing.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two \hyperref[def:player]{players}.
		\item \hyperref[def:strategy]{Actions} set: \(\left\{\text{split}, \text{ steal}\right\}\).
		\item \hyperref[def:reward]{Payoffs}: Assume the total \hyperref[def:reward]{rewards} is \(x\).
		      \begin{enumerate}
			      \item \((\text{split}, \text{split})\): \(\frac{x}{2}\) for both.
			      \item \((\text{split}, \text{steal})\): \hyperref[def:player]{player} who plays steal gets \(x\), steal gets \(0\).
			      \item \((\text{steal}, \text{steal})\): \(0\) for both.
		      \end{enumerate}
		      The \hyperref[def:payoff-matrix]{payoff matrix} is
		      \begin{table}[H]
			      \centering
			      \setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}
			      \begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|}
				                                                     & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\hyperref[def:player]{Player} 2}                                      \\
				                                                     & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\text{split}$}                  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\text{steal}$} \\\cline{3-4}
				      \multirow{2}*{\hyperref[def:player]{Player} 1} & $\text{split}$       & $(x/2, x/2)$                                        & $(0, x)$                           \\\cline{3-4}
				                                                     & $\text{steal}$       & $(x, 0)$                                            & $(0, 0)$                           \\\cline{3-4}
			      \end{tabular}
		      \end{table}
	\end{itemize}

	The \hyperref[def:player]{player} 1's reasoning should be as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If \hyperref[def:player]{player} 2 chooses to split \(\to \) since \(x>\frac{x}{2}\), the best \hyperref[def:strategy]{action} is to steal.
		\item If \hyperref[def:player]{player} 2 chooses to steal \(\to \) since \(0=0\), the best \hyperref[def:strategy]{action} is \emph{undetermined}.
	\end{itemize}

	We see that stealing is a \hyperref[def:weakly-dominant-strategy]{weakly dominant strategy} since it does not strictly outperform in every case.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}[Prisoner's dilemma ver. 2]\label{eg:prisoner-dilemma-ver2}
	Consider again the \hyperref[eg:prisoner-dilemma]{prisoner's dilemma}, but with different \hyperref[def:reward]{payoff} matrix.
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}
		\begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|}
			                          & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Player $2$}                                       \\
			                          & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\mathrm{NC}$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\mathrm{C}$} \\\cline{3-4}
			\multirow{2}*{Player $1$} & $\mathrm{NC}$        & $(-1, -1)$                        & $(-3, -2)$                       \\\cline{3-4}
			                          & $\mathrm{C}$         & $(-2, -3)$                        & $(-4, -4)$                       \\\cline{3-4}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	With the same analysis, we see that the equilibrium is not confessing, namely \((\mathrm{NC}, \mathrm{NC})\) is a dominant strategy equibrilium, furthermore, it's a
	strictly dominant strategy.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}[Two firms]\label{eg:two-firms}
	There are two firms competing with each other. They both have options to produce lower-priced products or upscale product. And we simply assume that
	their goal is to maximize the market share. We further assume that in the whole market, there are \(60\%\) of population will only buy low-priced products, and other \(40\%\)
	of population will only buy upscale products.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two firms.
		\item \hyperref[def:strategy]{Actions} set: \(\left\{\text{low-priced} (\mathrm{Lp}), \text{upscales}\right\} (\mathrm{Uc} )\)
		\item \hyperref[def:reward]{Payoffs}:
		      \begin{table}[H]
			      \centering
			      \setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}
			      \begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|}
				                            & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Firm 2}                                            \\
				                            & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\mathrm{Lp}$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\mathrm{Uc}$} \\\cline{3-4}
				      \multirow{2}*{Firm 1} & $\mathrm{Lp}$        & $(0.48, 0.12)$                    & $(0.6, 0.4)$                      \\\cline{3-4}
				                            & $\mathrm{Uc}$        & $(0.4, 0.6)$                      & $(0.32, 0.08)$                    \\\cline{3-4}
			      \end{tabular}
		      \end{table}
	\end{itemize}
	We see that firm 1's reasoning should be as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\mathrm{Lp}\) is a \hyperref[def:dominant-strategy]{strictly dominant strategy}.
	\end{itemize}

	We also see that firm 2's reasoning should be as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If firm 2 choose \(\mathrm{Lp} \to \mathrm{Uc}\)
		\item If firm 2 choose \(\mathrm{Uc} \to \mathrm{Lp}\)
	\end{itemize}

	We see that with \hyperref[common-knowledge]{common knowledge} and \hyperref[rationality]{rationality} assumptions,
	firm 2 will assume that firm 2 will play its \hyperref[def:dominant-strategy]{dominant strategy}.
	As a result, firm 2 will play \(\mathrm{Uc}\), hence, \((\mathrm{Lp}, \mathrm{Uc})\) is the \emph{equibrilium point}, and it's also \emph{efficient}.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}[Two firms ver. 2]\label{eg:two-firms-ver2}
	Consider the \hyperref[eg:two-firms]{two firms game}, but with three \hyperref[def:strategy]{actions}. The \hyperref[def:reward]{payoff} matrix now becomes
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}
		\begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|c|}
			                      & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Firm 2}                                                     \\
			                      & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$A$}    & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$B$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$C$} \\\cline{3-5}
			\multirow{3}*{Firm 1} & $A$                  & $(4, 4)$                   & $(0, 2)$                & $(0, 2)$                \\\cline{3-5}
			                      & $B$                  & $(0, 0)$                   & $(1, 1)$                & $(0, 2)$                \\\cline{3-5}
			                      & $C$                  & $(0, 0)$                   & $(0, 2)$                & $(1, 1)$                \\\cline{3-5}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

	To see the best response, we see that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For firm 1:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item If firm 2 play \(A\to \) pick \(A\).
			      \item If firm 2 play \(B\to \) pick \(B\).
			      \item If firm 2 play \(C\to \) pick \(C\).
		      \end{itemize}
		\item For firm \(2\):
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item If firm 1 play \(A\to \) pick \(A\).
			      \item If firm 1 play \(B\to \) pick \(C\).
			      \item If firm 1 play \(C\to \) pick \(B\).
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	We see that there are no \hyperref[def:dominant-strategy]{dominant strategy}. But \((A, A)\) is the \emph{equilibrium point}, which we will call it the \emph{Nash equilibrium}.
\end{eg}

\begin{note}
	One may notice that we are using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-form_game}{normal form} to describe \hyperref[def:one-shot-game]{one-shot games}.
	Contrarily, we will use so-called \emph{extensive form} to describe a \hyperref[def:dynamic-game]{dynamic game}.
\end{note}

\section{Nash Equilibrium}
We now have seen some examples of equilibrium, and we can now formalize it.
\begin{definition}[Nash equilibrium]\label{def:Nash-equilibrium}
	A set of players played \hyperref[def:strategy]{actions} is called a \emph{Nash Equilibrium}
	when each \hyperref[def:player]{player} doesn't have an incitement to \textbf{unilaterally deviate}.
\end{definition}

We further make two more useful definitions we'll later use. These notions generalize the notion of \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy}.

\begin{definition}[Pure strategy]\label{def:pure-strategy}
	We say a \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} is \emph{pure} if the \hyperref[def:player]{player} will play exactly one \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} deterministically.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Mixed strategy]\label{def:mixed-strategy}
	We say a \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} is \emph{mixed} if the \hyperref[def:player]{player} will play \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies} with some probability.
\end{definition}
\begin{intuition}
	Basically \autoref{def:strategy} is the same as \autoref{def:pure-strategy}, and \autoref{def:mixed-strategy} says that the \hyperref[def:player]{player} will
	play with some randomness.
\end{intuition}

We then define a \hyperref[def:game]{game} structure mathematically in the following way.
\begin{definition}[Mathematical game]\label{def:mathematical-game}
	Denote the set of \hyperref[def:player]{player} as \(\mathcal{I}\), with the number of the player being \(I\coloneqq \left\vert \mathcal{I} \right\vert \).
	Assume that each \hyperref[def:player]{player} \(i\) has a finite set \(\mathcal{S}_i\) of \hyperref[def:strategy]{actions} to choose from with size
	\(\left\vert \mathcal{S}_i \right\vert<\infty  \). Then, we can define a \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} vector \(s\), which denotes the
	\hyperref[def:strategy]{action} chosen by all \hyperref[def:player]{players} such that
	\[
		s\coloneqq (s_1, \ldots , s_I)
	\]
	with dimension being \(I\). We also define the vector of opponents' \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategy} \(s_{-i}\) such that
	\[
		s_{-i}\coloneqq (s_1,\ldots,s_{i - 1},s_{i + 1} ,\ldots,s_I)
	\]
	with dimension being \(I - 1\) for \hyperref[def:player]{player} \(i\).
	Finally, the \hyperref[def:reward]{utility} function for \hyperref[def:player]{player} \(i\) is
	\[
		u_{i} \coloneqq \prod\limits_{j = 1}^{I} \mathcal{S}_j \to \mathbb{\MakeUppercase{R}},
	\]
	where \(u_{i}(s) = u_{i}(s_1, \ldots , s_I) = u_{i}(s_{i}, s_{-i})\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Best response]\label{def:best-response}
	Given the \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies} of all other \hyperref[def:player]{players}, the subset of \(s_{i}\) that maximize the \hyperref[def:reward]{payoff}
	of \hyperref[def:player]{player} \(i\) is called the \emph{best response}, or \emph{best response correspondence}, denotes as \(\mathrm{BR}_i(s_{-i})\).
\end{definition}

\begin{intuition}
	\(\mathrm{BR}_i(s_{-i})\) can be though as follows: For \hyperref[def:player]{player} \(i\), given every other \hyperref[def:player]{players}'
	\hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies} they will play, find the optimal response. And since there may be several \hyperref[def:strategy]{strategies} can achieve
	the optimal \hyperref[def:reward]{reward}, so it's should be a set.
\end{intuition}

\begin{remark}
	Note that mathematically, \(\mathrm{BR}_i(s_{-i}) \subseteq \mathcal{S}_i\) such that
	\[
		\mathrm{BR}_i(s_{-i})= \underset{s_{i}\in\mathcal{S}_i}{\arg\max}\ u_{i}(s_{i}, s_{-i}).
	\]
\end{remark}
