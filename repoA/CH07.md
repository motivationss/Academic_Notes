# Chapter 7 Classes

The fundamental ideas behind classes are *data abstraction* and *encapsulation*. Data abstraction is a programming (and design) technique that relies on the separation of *interface* and *implementation*. The *interface* of a class consists of the operations that users of the class can execute. The implementation includes the class' data members, the bodies of the functions that constitute the interface, and any functions needed to defien the calss that are not intended for general use.

Encapsulation enforeces the separation of a class' interface and implementation.

A class that uses data abstraction and encapsulation defins an *abstract data type*.


## 7.1 Defining Abstract Data Types

**Const Member Functions**

Example:

    std::string isbn() const { return this->bookNo; }
   
   The purpose of the *const* here is to modify the type of the implicit *this* pointer.

By default, the type of *this* is a *const* pointer to the non*const* version of the class type. 

To prevent such problems, the language resolves this problem by letting us put *const* after the parameter list of a members. Member functions that use *const* in this way are **const member functions**.

You can think of the body of *isbn* as if it were written as

    std::string Sales_data::isbn(const Sales_data *const this)
	    {return this-> isbn; }

**Defining a Function to Return "This" Object**

    Sales_data& Sales_data::combine(const Sales_data &rhs) {
	    unit_sold += rhs.units_sold;
	    revenue += rhs.revenue;
	    return *this;
    }

Some common functions

    istream &read(istream &is, Sales_data &item) {
    	double price = 0;
    	is >> item.bookNo >> item.units_sold >> price;
    	item.revenue = price * item.units.sold;
    	return is;
    }

### Constructors

 - Used to initialize the data members of a class object. A constructor is run whenever an object of a class type is created.
 - Unlike other member functions, constructors may not be declared as *const*.
 - The compiler-generated constructor is known as the **synthesized default constructor**.

**Constructor Initializer List**

    Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s). {}
    Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p): 
			   bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { }

 - The part after colon is the constructor initializer list, which specifies initial values for one or more data members of the object being created.
 - It is best for a constructor to use an in-class initializer if one exists and gives the member the correct value.

An example of construtor of Sales_data

    struct Sales_data {
	    Sales_data() = default;
	    Sales_data(const std::string &no): bookNo(no) {}
	    Sales_data(const std::string &no, unsigned us, double price): bookNo(no), units_sold(us), revenue(us * price) {}
	    Sales_data(std::istream &is);
		
		std::istring isbn() const { return bookNo; }
		Sales_data &combine (const Sales_data&);
				
		std::string bookNo;
		unsigned units_sold = 0;
		double revenue = 0.0;

    }
    
    Sales_data &Sales_data::combine(const Sales_data &rhs) {
	    units_sold += rhs.units_sold;
	    revenue += rhs.revenue;
	    return *this;
	}
	// omit rest functions

## 7.2 Access Control and Encapsulation

 - Public: accessible to all parts of the program. The public members define the interface to the class
 - Private: accessible to the member functions of the class but are not accessible to code that uses the class. The private sections encapsulate the implementation

**Class and Structs**

 When we define a class intending for all its members to be *public*, we use *struct*. If we intend to have *private* members, then we use *class*.

 - The constructors and member functions that are part of the interface should be defined after a  `public`  specifier.
 - The data members and member functions that are part of the implementation should be defined after a  `private`  specifier.

**Friend**

A class can allow another class or function to access its nonpublic members by making that class or function a *friend*.

## 7.3 Additional Class Features

**Mutable**

 - We want to make the data member to be able to be modified, even
   inside a *const* member function. We indicate such members by
   including the *mutable* keyword in their declaration.
   
 - A mutable data member is never const, even it is a member of a const
   object.
   
 - Accrodingingly, a const member function may change a mutable member

Example:

    class Screen {
    public:
	    void some_member() const;
    private:
	    mutable size_t access_ctr;
    };
    
    void Screen::some_member() const {
		++access_ctr;  //OK
		// This tracks Num of functions called
	} 

**Class declarations**

Below is Equivalent:

    Sales_data item1;
    class Sales_data item1;

Another example:

    class Screen; // Declaration of the Screen class

 - The above declaration is referred to as a forward declaration.
 - The type Screen is an incomplete type. 
 - We can use an incomplete type if and only if:
   - define pointers or references to such types
   - declare(but not define) functions that use an incomplete type as a parameter or return type

Generally speaking, a class MUST BE DEFINED - not just declared- before we can write code that creates object of that type.

## 7.5 Consturctors Revisited

Comparison with our famililar varialbe assignments:

    string foo = "Hello World"; // define and initialize
    string bar;					// default initialized to the empty string
    bar = "Hello World!"		// assign a new value to bar

BAD CONVENSION IN CLASS CONSTRUCTORS:

    Sales_data::Sales_data(const string &s, unsigned cnt, double price){
	    bookNo = s;
	    units_sold = cnt;
	    revenue = cnt * price;
    }
In this case, we *assign* values to the data members instead of "initializing" the data memebrs.

 - Members that are **const** or references must be initialized. Similiarly, members that are of a class type that does not define a default a constructor also must be defined.

This is where the PROBLEM appears:

    class ConstRef{
    public:
	    ConstRef(int ii);
    private:
	    int i;
	    const int ci;
	    int &ri;
    };
    
    ConstRef::ConstRef(int ii){
	    i = ii;
	    c = ii;  // ERROR: cannot assign to a const
	    ri = i; // ERROR: ri was never initialized
    }:

Interesting Fact:
There are orders of Member Initialization

    Class X{
	    int i;
	    int j;
    public:
	    X(int val): j(val), i(j) { }
    };
But this is not good, we should write

    X(int val): i(val), j(val) { }

#### Delegating constructors

A delegating constructor uses another constructor from its own class to perform its initializatinon.

    class Sales_data {
    public:
	    // nondelegating constructor
	    Sales_data(std::string s, unsigned cnt, double price): bookNo(s), units_sold(cnt), revenue(cnt*price) {}
	    // rest all being delegating
	    Sales_data(): Sales_data("", 0, 0) {}
	    Sales_data(std::string s): Sales_data(s, 0, 0) {}
	    Sales_data(std::istream &is): Sales_data () {read(is, *this);}
    };

**Default Constructors**

An ez mistake to make:

    Sales_data obj(); 
    if (obj.isbn() == Primer_5th_ed.isbn());

There are errors because obj() defines a function. The correct way should be:

    Sales_data obj; // default-initialized

**Class conversion**

Examples:

    // explicit conversion to string, implicit conversion to Sales_data
    item.combine(string("9-999-99999-9"));
    // implicit conversion to string, explicit conversion to Sales_data
    item.combine(Sales_data("9-999-99999-9"))

If we don't want implicit conversion, we could define certain constructos as "explicit". like below:

    explicit Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s);

However, at the same, explicit constructors can be used only for direct initialization.

    Sales_data item1 (null_book); //OK
    Sales_data item2 = null_book; //ERROR: can't use the copy form of initialization

Or, we could explicitly using constructors for conversions.

    item.combine(static_cast<Sales_data>(cin));


#### Aggregate Class

 - All of its data members are public
 - It does not define any constructors
 - It has no in-class initializers
 - It has no base classes or virtual functions

Example:

    struct Data{
	    int ival;
	    string s;
    };

We can initialize the data members of an aggregate class by providing a braced list of member initializers:

    Data vall = { 0, "Anna" };
    
This must follow the order of the variables!

**Literal Classes**
involves constexpr; read for interest

## 7.6 Static Class Members

 - static var_Name;
 - static members could be public or private or const or reference or arr or class

Example:

    class Account {
    public:
	    void calculate() { amount += amount * interestRate; }
	    static double rate() { return interestRate; }
    private:
	    std::string owner;
	    double amount;
	    static double interestRate;
	    static double initRate();
    };
Very Reasonable use of "static"

**Using a class static member**

    double r;
    r = Account::rate();
    
    Account ac1;
    Account *ac2 = &ac1;
    r = ac1.rate();
    r = ac2->rate();

**Defining static Members**

 - We can define a static member function inside or outside of the class body. 
   - When we define a static member outside the class, we do not repeat the static keyword.
 - static data member may be defined only once
 - we may not initialize a static member inside the class
 - We must define and initialize each static data member outside the class body
 - We can provide in-class initializers for static members that have *const* integral type and must do so for *static* memebers that are *constexpr* of literal type.

E.g 

    class Account{
    private:
	    static constexpr int period = 30;
    //omit codes...
    };
