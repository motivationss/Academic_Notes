\section{Elementary Properties and Examples}

Let \(f \colon X \to Y \) be a function between metric spaces (\(X, d_X\)) and 
(\(Y, d_Y\)). Then \(f\) is \textbf{continuous} at \(x_0 \in X\) if, for each 
neighborhood \(V\) of \(f\left(x_0\right)\) in \(Y\), there is a neighborhood
\(U\) of \(x_0\) in \(X\) such that \(f\left(U\right) \subseteq V\).
