# Chapter 2 Variables and Basic Types

A chapter about pointers, const, compound types and some fancy tricks

## 2.1 Primitive Built-in Types

### Arithmetic Types

 - Integral Types
   - include character and boolean types
  - Floating-point Types

|Type|Minimum Size  |
|--|--|
| bool | NA |
| char | 8 bits |
| wchar_t | 16 bits |
| char16_t | 16 bits |
| char32_t | 32 bits |
| short | 16 bits |
| int | 16 bits |
| long | 32 bits |
| long long | 64 bits |
| float | 6 significant digits |
| double | 10 significant digits |
| long double | 10 significant digits |

### Signed and Unsigned Types

Except bool and the extended character types, the integral types may be *signed* or *unsigned*

 - Signed : positive or negative (include 0)
 - Unsigned: nonnegative

### Type Conversions

Examples:
  

    bool b = 42;		// b is true
    int i = b;			// i is 1
    i = 3.14;			// i is 3
    double pi = i;		// pi is 3.0
    unsigned char c = -1; // c has value 255 (8 bits)
    signed char c2 = 256; // undefined value for 8 bits

Some tricky cases:

    unsigned u = 10;
    int i = -42;
    std::cout << i + i << std::endl;
    std::cout << u + i << std::endl;

The first cout is normal print -84;
However, the second would print 4294967264 for 32 bits since the int value -42 is converted to unsigned

There's caution to loop with *unsigned* since unsigned always nonegative

### Literals

 - Integer literals that begin with *0* are octal, begin with *0x* or *0X* are hexadecimal.
 - default for floating-point literals are type *double*
 - string literals is array of const chars
 - nullptr is pointer literal
 
 
### Escape Sequences

    \n	\t	\a(alert/bell)	\v(vertical tab)
    \b	\"	\'	\\	\?	\r
    \0(null)	\12(newline)	\40(blank)
    \x4d('M')

## 2.2 Variables

### Definitions

 Type specifier + a list of one or more variable names separated by commas, and end with a semicolon.
 Example:
 

    int sum = 0, value,
	    units_sold = 0;
  
  ### Initializers

An object that is *initialized* gets the specified value at the moment it is created.

    double price = 109.99, discount = price * 0.16;
    // price defined and initialized and before it is used to initialize discount

NOTE:
INITIALIZATION and ASSIGNEMNT are DIFFERENT!  
**=** in most cases are considered as copy and less efficient than initialization

### List Initialization

OK:

    int a = 0;
    int a = {0};
    int a{0};
    int a(a);
However, we cannot list-intialize variables of built-in type if the initializer might lead to loss of information

    long double ld = 3.1415926;
    int a{ld}, b = {ld}; //error
    int c(ld), d = ld;   // very OK

### Default initialization

 - Variables defined outside any function body are intialized to zero
 - Variables of built-in type defined inside a function have no default initialization and are called *unintialized* this case. Or *undefined* equivalently.

### Declarations and Definitions

Separate Compilation.

 - Declaration: makes a name known to the program
 - Definition: creates the associated entity

*extern* only declares

    extern int i; //declares but does not define i
    int j; 		  // declares and defines j

It is error to provide an intializer on an extern inside a function.

## 2.3 Compound Types

 - A compound type is a type that is defined in terms of another type.
 - A declaration is a base type followed a list of declarators.

### References

A *reference* defines an alternative name for an object.

    int ival = 1024;
    int &refVal = ival;
    int &refVal2; 	//error: a reference must be initialized

 

 - Ordinarily, when we initialize a variable, the value of the initializer is copied into the object we are creating.
 - For references, we don't copy the initializer's value.
 - we **bind** the reference to the initializer.
 - The reference always remains bound to its initial objec. There is no way to rebind it to refer to a different object.
 - REFERENCE MUST BE INITIALIZED
 - Reference could just be considered as the same thing as the original, lives in the same address but different name

### Reference Definitions

    int i = 1024, i2 = 2048;
    int &r = i, r2 = i2;
    int i3 = 1024, &ri = i3;
    int &r3 = i3, &r4 = i2;

REFERENCE TYPES  MUST MATCH!

### Pointers

A pointer is a compound type that "points to" another type. It has its own address and does not have to tbe initialized at the time it is defined.

    int	*ip1, *ip2;	// both pointers to int
    int ival = 42;
    int *p = &ival;

Pointer also has to match types

    double dval;
    double *pd = &dval;		//OK
    double *pd2 = pd;		//OK
    int *pi = pd;			//ERROR
    pi = &dval;				//ERROR

"*" also is a dereference operator.

> We may dereference only a valid pointer that points to an object

**Null pointer** : nullptr

> Advice: Initialize all Pointers

Interesting case:

void* Pointers, which are pointers that hold the address of any object but the type of the object at that address is unknown:

    double obj = 3.14, *pd = obj;
    void *pv = &obj;	//OK
    pv = pd;			//OK

### Fancy Tricks

    int i = 1024, *p = &i, &r = i;

### Convensions

Bad convension:

    int* p; 	//legal but misleading

The base type is int, instead of int*. 
`*` modifies the type of p.

### Pointers to Pointers

We indicate each pointer level by its own `*`. That is, we write `**` for a pointer to a pointer and `***` for a pointer to a pointer to a pointer

    int val = 1024;
    int *pi = &val;
    int **ppi = &pi;

So, in order to get the value of `val` from `ppi`, we have to dereference `ppi` twice.

    **ppi

### References to Pointers

Example:

    int i = 42;
    int *p;
    int *&r = p;	// r is a reference to the pointer p
    r = &i;		// r refers to a pointer; assigning &i to r makes p point to i
    *r = 0;		// dereferencing r yields i,changes i to 0

Definitions are from *right to left*. The symbol closest to the name of the variable is the one that has the most immediate effect on the variable's type.


## 2.4 Const Qualifier

Fix a variable. Const has to be initialized.

    const int j = 42;
    const int k; //error

### References to const

    const int ci = 1024;
    const int &r1 = ci;	//OK
    r1 = 42;			//ERROR
    int &r2 = ci;		//ERROR

### Intialization and References to const

 - We can bind a reference to `const` to a `nonconst` object, a literal, or a more general expression.
Example:

        int i = 42;
       const int &r1 = i;		//OK
       const int &r2 = 42;	 	//OK
       const int &r3 = r1 * 2;	//OK

Even this is OK:

    double dval = 3.14;
    const int &ri = dval;

But ri is bound to a temporary object.

A reference to a const may refer to an object that is non-const.

 - a reference to *const* restricts only what we can do thru that reference
 - Binding a reference to *const* to an object says nothing about whether the underlying object itself is *const* or not

Example:

  

      int i = 42;
      const int &r2 = i;	//r2 is bound to i but cannot be used to change i

### Pointers and const

 - A pointer to const may not be used to change the object to which the pointer points
 - We may store the address of a *const* object only in a pointer to *const*

Example:

    const double pi = 3.14;
    const double *cptr = &pi;

**Const pointers**

 - Unlike reference, pointers are objects.
 - We can have pointer that itself is *const*
 - A const pointer must be initialized and once initialize, its value may not be changed
 - We indicate that the pointer is *const* by putting the *const* after the `*`.
 - This indicates that it is the pointer, not the pointed-to type that is const.

Let's see the example:

    int errNumb = 0;
    int *const curErr = &errNumb; 	// curErr will always point to errNumb
    const double pi = 3.1415;
    const double *const pip = &pi;	// pip is a const pointer to a const object

### TOP AND BOT LEVEL CONST

 - Top-level const: the pointer itself is const or not.
 - Low-level const: the point-to is const or not.

Example:

    int i = 0;
    int *const p1 = &i;		// top-level, we cannot change the value of p1
    const int ci = 42;		// top level, we cannot change ci
    const int *p2 = &ci;	// low level, we cannot change ci
    const int *const p3 = p2; // rightmost const is top-level, the left not
    const int &r = ci;		// const in reference is always low-level

TOP and BOT level MATTERS when we copy an object.

When we copy an object, **top-level consts are ignored**.

    i = ci;		//OK
    p2 = p3;	//OK

However, low-level const is never ignored.

    int *p = p3;	//error, low-level p3 has low-level but p2 doesn't
    p2 = p3;		//OK: same low-level
    p2 = &i;		//OK
    int &r = ci;	//ERROR
    const int &r2 = i; //OK

### constexpr and Constant Expressions

 - A constant expression is an expression whose value cannot change and that can be evaluated at compile time. 
 
 See below:

    const int a = 20;		// const expression
    int b = 2;				// NO
    const int sz = get_size // No because not unknown at compile time

### constexpr Variables

We can ask the compiler to verify that a variable is a constant expression by declaring the variable in a constexpr declaration. 

Variables declared as constexpr are implicitly const and must be initialized by const expressions:

    constexpr int mf = 20;

Another one with pointers

    const int *p = nulltr;
    // p is a pointer to a const int
    constexpr int *q = nullptr;
    // q is a const pointer to int

## 2.5 Dealing with Types

### Type Aliases

A type alias is a name that is a synonym for another type

We may use a `typedef`:

    typedef double wages; // wages is a synonym for double
    typedef wages base, *p; // base is a synonym for double, p for double*

### The auto Type specifier

  The `auto` specifier tells the compiler to deduce the type from the initializer.

### The decltype Type Specifier

Define a variable with a type that the compiler deduces from an expression but do not use that expression to initialize the varialbe

    decltype (f()) sum = x;		// sum has whatever type f returns

More examples:

    int i = 42, *p = &i, &r = i;
    decltype(r + 0) b;	//OK
    decltype(*p) c;		//ERROR: c is int& and must be initialized
