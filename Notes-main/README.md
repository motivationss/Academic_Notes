# Lecture Notes @University of Michigan

## Abstract

This repo contains all lecture notes I took in Umich by LaTeX together with Inkscape. The[ `header.tex`](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Academic-Template/blob/main/Notes/header.tex) is in [Academic Template](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Academic-Template), which can be freely adjusted in order to meet your own needs. **You need to include this header in order to complie!** The particular compile environment should be not that relvant, since the packages this environment depends on are quite straightforward and minimal, hence a simple `pdflatex` should do the job. As for Inkscape figures, please look into [VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape](https://github.com/sleepymalc/VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape) and also [inkscape-figures](https://github.com/sleepymalc/inkscape-figures) for detailed configuration. Feel free to submit pull requests if you find typos and want to fix them. 

Finally, a simple, but complete demo is available in [Note](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Academic-Template/tree/main/Notes), please check it out if you're interested.

## About Honor Code

According to the UM [Academic Rules, Rights and Responsibilities](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/rules/),

> It is always required that ideas and materials obtained from another student or from any other source be acknowledged in one’s work. The latter is particularly important, because material is so freely available on the Internet. According to Merriam-Webster online dictionary, to plagiarize is “To steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one’s own.” To avoid plagiarism, it is necessary to cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the Internet.
